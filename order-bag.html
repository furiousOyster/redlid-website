							<p>Here is everything you need to know about purchasing and using our residential Green Waste collection services ordered
								through our website or in person.*</p>
							<h3>1.    Making orders</h3>
							<p>When you place an order with us, you agree to use our services on a regular, ongoing basis until you cancel in accordance
								with clause 6.  You will need an email address that you check regularly, as this is the preferred option for communication.</p>
							<h3>2.    Delivering your Bin or Bag</h3>
							<p>We will deliver your garden Bin or Bag on the next working day that we are in your suburb.</p>
							<h3>3.    Scheduled collections</h3>
							<p>We will empty your Bin or Bag on the scheduled collection date &amp; cycle that has been approved by you either by
								phone, email or through our website, unless we have notified you in advance by email or phone message that the date
								has changed. Where your scheduled collection falls on a public holiday your collection day may change, you will be
								notified before the scheduled collection day if there is a change.</p>
							<h3>4.    Charges</h3>
							<p>Our price is determined by the service address you provided to us, so any change to your address may result in a different
								price being charged. Our prices include GST. We can also remove extra side rubbish for an additional fee if notified.</p>
							<h3>5.    Payment</h3>
							<p>After you receive your Bin or Bag a $60 payment is required before the first collection, this advance payment goes
								onto your account and your collection charges are deducted from it, once you have used your $60, simply pay a further
								$60. Payments can be made by credit card, cheque, internet banking or automatic payment.</p>
							<h3>6.    Cancelling your service</h3>
							<p>You can end your service at any time via email or phone message after the initial $60 has been used. We will keep
								emptying your Bin or Bag until your prepaid period expires. No refund will be given if the service is cancelled before
								the $60 advance payment has been used.</p>
							<p>On cancellation you agree to allow us access to the property for the purpose of collecting and removing our Bin or
								Bag.
							</p>
							<h3>7.    No access policy</h3>
							<p>If we are not able to collect/empty your Bin or Bag due to restricted access for example Bin or Bag is behind locked
								gates, dogs are running free or a vehicle is blocking access, please email or phone the office and we will collect
								the Bin or Bag on the next day we are in your area at no extra charge. Your following collection date will remain
								the same.</p>
							<h3>8.    Using and looking after your Garden Waste Bin or Bag</h3>
							<p>Please DO:</p>
							<ol>
								<li>Put your Bin out by 7am on the day of your collection.</li>
								<li> Place your Bin on the grass verge or berm closest to where our collection vehicle passes, so the wheels are closest
									to your house and the lid is closest to the road. Make sure the bin is clear of trees and other obstructions like
									parked cars or street light poles.</li>
								<li>Contain all the waste inside your Bin or Bag without letting it spill over, and ensure the lid is closed on the Bin
									or not over the top of the frame of the garden Bag.</li>
								<li>Ensure your Garden Waste Bin or Bag contains approved organic waste as outlined in clause 9 below. If your Bin is
									not out for collection on your scheduled collection day, our drivers will enter your property to collect it if they
									can gain access. If you DO NOT want us to enter your property please notify us by email or phone, the collection
									charge will remain.</li>
							</ol>
							<p>Please do NOT:</p>
							<ol>
								<li>Light fires or place hot embers or hot ash in the Bin or Bag.</li>
								<li>Put any liquids or explosive, toxic, dangerous, hazardous or noxious materials in the Bin or Bag. This includes materials
									like asbestos, acids, solvents, paints, unwrapped broken glass, minerals, grease or cooking oil, or concrete.</li>
								<li> Fill the bin to overflowing.</li>
							</ol>
							<h3>9.    Garden Waste</h3>
							<p>Please ensure your Garden Waste bin only contains approved organic waste.  We cannot accept, sand, grass sods, dirt
								or soil, rocks, household rubbish, newspaper, old compost, stumps or branches bigger than 100mm in diameter in the
								Garden Waste Bin or Bag. Bins or Bags containing any forbidden material will not be taken as this cannot be composted
								successfully. An additional charge will apply if forbidden material is found in the Bin or Bag.</p>
							<p>You can order extra collections in addition to your scheduled collections by contacting us in advance. These extra
								collections will be charged for at the rates applicable at the time. You will be informed of the scheduled date for
								extra collections in your area when you contact us.</p>
							<h3>10.    Bin &amp; Bag Placement</h3>
							<p>Please ensure the Garden Waste Bin or Bag is NOT in a difficult position such as steep driveways, narrow access ways
								and steps that may impede the driver&rsquo;s ability to empty the Bin or Bag, resulting in a non-service. Unlock
								gates and tie up or secure dogs away from the Bin or Bag location.</p>
							<p>We reserve the right to refuse our collection service to any property where the site is deemed by us to be unsafe.</p>
							<h3>11.    Liability</h3>
							<p>You will be liable to us for any damage to our Bin or Bag whilst in your possession, fair wear and tear excluded,
								and for any liability we incur as a result of you not complying with these terms.</p>
							<h3>12.    Making changes</h3>
							<p>
								<strong>Changes to Terms</strong>
							</p>
							<p>From time to time we may need to change these terms, including adding new ones. We want to make sure we&rsquo;re acting
								reasonably and in good faith. If any changes we make could have a detrimental impact on you, we will give you at
								least 28 days&rsquo; notice of the change by emailing or phoning you. Continuing to use our services after being
								notified in this way indicates you accept the changes. If you do not agree to the changes, you have the right to
								terminate this agreement.</p>
							<p>
								<strong>Changes to Charges</strong>
							</p>
							<p>We may change our prices from time to time. When we increase the prices for your services we will give you 28 days&rsquo;
								notice by emailing or phoning you.</p>
							<p>
								<strong>Changes to Services</strong>
							</p>
							<p>We may change our services from time to time. If the change is within our control, we will provide you 28 days&rsquo;
								notice of such alterations by emailing or phoning you.</p>
							<h3>13.    Privacy</h3>
							<p>You authorise us to collect, keep and use personal information you provide to us to process payment for our services,
								or for any other purpose that you authorise. We comply with the Privacy Act 1993, and you have the right to access
								and correct any personal information we hold about you (there may be a reasonable charge for this).</p>
							<p>* In these Terms, "us" &ldquo;our&rdquo; or "we" means Red Lid Garden Bins &amp; Bags Ltd (the owner of this website),
								and &ldquo;you&rdquo; means our customer, who purchases services from us on this website.</p>
							<h3>14. Recovering Collection Costs</h3>
							<p>In the event where your account goes into arrears due to non-payment and is referred to a collection agency and/or
								law firm, you will be liable for a 25% plus gst recovery fee which will be incurred as if the debt is collected in
								full, including legal demand costs.</p>
