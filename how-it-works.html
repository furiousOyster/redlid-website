  <li>We can also leave extra bags  for big clean up&rsquo;s</li>
  <li>We can do one off/casual  collections of a 600 litre Garden Bag</li>

  Garden Bins are collected from the kerbside  on your collection day.  Please have the  Bin on the kerb by 7am.  We service each suburb  on the same day each week.  If for some  reason you cannot get your Garden Bin to the kerb you can arrange with us to do  so at <strong>NO EXTRA COST</strong>.</p>
  <p><strong>&ldquo;WE BELIEVE WE WILL NOT BE BEATEN ON  SERVICE&rdquo;</strong></p>
  <p><strong>OUR VISION IS TO BE THE NUMBER 1 GREEN WASTE COLLECTOR IN THE WAIKATO</strong></p>


<h2>About us</h2>
<p>We are proud to be rated the Number 1 Green  Waste Collectors in the Waikato.</p>
<p>Hamilton Garden Bags was established in  1989 and then purchased by brothers Grant &amp; Steve Wilson in 1998.&nbsp; In 2015 the name was changed to Red Lid  Garden Bins &amp; Bags Ltd.&nbsp; We started out  with one tandem trailer which was very hard work in the early days.&nbsp; But through hard work and a commitment to  providing the best customer service, we are now proud of our fleet of 7 purpose  built compactor trucks. </p>
<p> Our Vision to be The Number 1 Green Waste Collector  in the Waikato drives our passion to deliver the best possible customer  service.&nbsp; We have a team that believes in  our Vision and we are proud of what we achieve every day.</p>
<p>We provide more Collection Frequency  options than any other company in the Waikato.&nbsp;  “Good as Gold”&nbsp; “Not a problem” is  all part of our very prompt and reliable service. We pride ourselves on delivering the best  service in the Waikato.</p>
<p> We are proud to be doing our part for the environment  as all the Greenwaste we collect is recycled into compost products which  reduces the estimated 40% of Greenwaste that goes to landfills each year.</p>
<p>2018 has been an exciting year with the addition of RedLid Skips. This came about as our existing customers were contacting us on a regular basis and asking if we had skips. The decision was made to provide skips but not just for Greenwaste. We also provide skips for General waste and Hard fill. At this stage we are only providing skips in Hamilton and Cambridge.</p>
<p>Red Lid Garden Bins &amp; Bags are proud to  be 100% Hamilton owned &amp; operated and committed to providing the best Green  Waste Collection service in the Waikato. </p>

Where your scheduled collection falls on a public holiday your collection day may change, you will be notified before the scheduled collection day if there is a change.</p>
<h3>4.    Charges</h3>

Payments can be made by credit card, cheque, internet banking or automatic payment.</p>
<h3>6.    Cancelling your service</h3>
<p>You can end your service at any time via email or phone message after the initial $60 has been used. We will keep emptying your Bin or Bag until your prepaid period expires. No refund will be given if the service is cancelled before the $60 advance payment has been used.</p>

Your following collection date will remain the same.</p>

<p>Please DO:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Put your Bin out by 7am on the day of your collection.</li>
  <li> Place your Bin on the grass verge or berm closest to where our collection vehicle passes, so the wheels are closest to your house and the lid is closest to the road. Make sure the bin is clear of trees and other obstructions like parked cars or street light poles.</li>
  <li>Contain all the waste inside your Bin or Bag without letting it spill over, and ensure the lid is closed on the Bin or not over the top of the frame of the garden Bag.</li>
  <li>Ensure your Garden Waste Bin or Bag contains approved organic waste as outlined in clause 9 below.

<h3>10.    Bin &amp; Bag Placement</h3>
<p>Please ensure the Garden Waste Bin or Bag is NOT in a difficult position such as steep driveways, narrow access ways and steps that may impede the driver&rsquo;s ability to empty the Bin or Bag, resulting in a non-service.
