      <h2>About us</h2>

      <p>
        We are proud to be rated the Number 1 Green Waste Collectors in the
        Waikato.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hamilton Garden Bags was established in 1989 and then purchased by
        brothers Grant &amp; Steve Wilson in 1998.&nbsp; In 2015 the name was
        changed to Red Lid Garden Bins &amp; Bags Ltd.&nbsp; We started out with
        one tandem trailer which was very hard work in the early days.&nbsp; But
        through hard work and a commitment to providing the best customer
        service, we are now proud of our fleet of 7 purpose built compactor
        trucks.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our Vision to be The Number 1 Green Waste Collector in the Waikato
        drives our passion to deliver the best possible customer service.&nbsp;
        We have a team that believes in our Vision and we are proud of what we
        achieve every day.
      </p>

      <p>
        We provide more Collection Frequency options than any other company in
        the Waikato.&nbsp; “Good as Gold”&nbsp; “Not a problem” is all part of
        our very prompt and reliable service. We pride ourselves on delivering
        the best service in the Waikato.
      </p>

      <p>
        We are proud to be doing our part for the environment as all the
        Greenwaste we collect is recycled into compost products which reduces
        the estimated 40% of Greenwaste that goes to landfills each year.
      </p>

      <p>
        2018 has been an exciting year with the addition of RedLid Skips. This
        came about as our existing customers were contacting us on a regular
        basis and asking if we had skips. The decision was made to provide skips
        but not just for Greenwaste. We also provide skips for General waste and
        Hard fill. Serving the greater Waikato region.
      </p>

      <p>
        Red Lid Garden Bins &amp; Bags are proud to be 100% Hamilton owned &amp;
        operated and committed to providing the best Green Waste Collection
        service in the Waikato.
