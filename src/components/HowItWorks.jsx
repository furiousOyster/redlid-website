        <h2>About us</h2>

        <p>
          We are proud to be rated the Number 1 Green Waste Collectors in the
          Waikato.
        </p>

        <p>
          Hamilton Garden Bags was established in 1989 and then purchased by
          brothers Grant &amp; Steve Wilson in 1998.&nbsp; In 2015 the name was
          changed to Red Lid Garden Bins &amp; Bags Ltd.&nbsp; We started out
          with one tandem trailer which was very hard work in the early
          days.&nbsp; But through hard work and a commitment to providing the
          best customer service, we are now proud of our fleet of 9 purpose
          built compactor trucks.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our Vision to be The Number 1 Green Waste Collector in the Waikato
          drives our passion to deliver the best possible customer
          service.&nbsp; We have a team that believes in our Vision and we are
          proud of what we achieve every day.
        </p>

        <p>
          We provide more Collection Frequency options than any other company in
          the Waikato.&nbsp; “Good as Gold”&nbsp; “Not a problem” is all part of
          our very prompt and reliable service. We pride ourselves on delivering
          the best service in the Waikato.
        </p>

        <p>
          We are proud to be doing our part for the environment as all the
          Greenwaste we collect is recycled into compost products which reduces
          the estimated 40% of Greenwaste that goes to landfills each year.
        </p>

        <p>
          Red Lid Garden Bins &amp; Bags are proud to be 100% Hamilton owned
          &amp; operated and committed to providing the best Green Waste
          Collection service in the Waikato.
